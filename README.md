# hello-world
first repository from the tutorial
My name is Beatrix, but I go by Be, as in exist. 
  I love coding in java and am excited to get involved in the GitHub community! I am an aspiring app and software developer who has dreams of helping shape the software in IoT devices to ensure more ethical and safe practices that allow intersectionallity and accessability to all individuals and communities.
  Outside of computer science, my interests include mathematics(specifically game theory and algorithms), linguistics, the science behind coffee, and fashion and textiles.
  Hopefully through collaboration and integration of ideas, we can work together, and change the world!
